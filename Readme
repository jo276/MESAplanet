This code is a modified verision of the mesa code to run planetary evolution calculations with photoevaporation.
It is used in the paper by Owen (2020) arXiv:2009.03919 to constrain the entropy of young planets. 

The notebook Young_planets_MESA_analysis contains the python analysis notebook from that paper. 

WARNING: To run the full young planets grid analysis from the paper requires several 10,000 CPU hours and
will need to be run on a HPC cluster. 

# Basic setup of planetary computations with mesa, written by JO, June 2016

# Pre-requites:
mesa code v6208 and patched
mesa sdk toolkit v245
nugrid.mesa python module
python namelist fortran module

# download mesa from web:
1 create directory where mesa is to be installed

2 cd into said directory

3 download mesa with : svn co -r 6208 svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/mesa/code/trunk mesa

4 download mesasdk : wget --user-agent="" http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/resource/download/mesasdk/mesasdk-x86_64-linux-20141023.tar.gz

5 setup environment variables to point to certain directories:
MESA_DIR should point to mesa installation directory
MESASDK_ROOT should point to sdk installation directory

6 load sdk into path with: source $MESASDK_ROOT/bin/mesasdk_init.sh or use .csh for c-shell

7 in directory planet_mesa/mesa_patch run patch.sh and it will patch mesa for planet calculations

8 compile mesa - cd into mesa top level e.g. cd $MESA_DIR and then run ./install

9 edit planets directory in pampas_run.py to point to correct location

10 install mesa python module: pip install nugridpy

11 run planet build and evolution calculations: python pampas_run.py 0 0 1 1
